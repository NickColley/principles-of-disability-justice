## Intersectionality
&ldquo;We do not live single issue lives&rdquo; &ndash; Audre Lorde. Ableism, coupled with white supremacy, supported by capitalism, underscored by heteropatriarchy, has rendered the vast majority of the world &lsquo;invalid&rsquo;.

## Leadership of Those Most Impacted
&ldquo;We are led by those who most know these systems.&rdquo; &ndash; Aurora Levins Morales

## Anti-Capitalist Politic
In an economy that sees land and humans as components of profit, we are anti-capitalist by the nature of having non-conforming body/minds.

## Commitment to Cross-Movement Organising
Shifting how social justice movements understand disability and contextualize ableism, disability justice lends itself to politics of alliance.

## Recognizing Wholeness
People have inherent worth outside of commodity relations and capitalist notions of productivity. Each person is full of history and life experience.

## Sustainability
We pace ourselves, individually and collectively, to be sustained long term. Our embodied experiences guide us toward ongoing justice and liberation.

## Commitment to Cross-Disability Solidarity
We honor the insights and participation of all of our community members, knowing that isolation undermines collective liberation.

## Interdependence
We meet each others’ needs as we build toward liberation, knowing that state solutions inevitably extend into further control over lives.

## Collective Access
As brown, black and queer-bodied disabled people we bring flexibility and creative nuance that go beyond able-bodied/minded normativity, to be in community with each other.

## Collective Liberation
No body or mind can be left behind – only moving together can we accomplish the revolution we require.
